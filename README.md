# Gunfire on School Grounds Dashboard

This repository contains a **Streamlit** dashboard for analyzing gunfire incidents on school grounds in the United States. It automatically fetches data from [Everytown Research](https://everytownresearch.org/maps/gunfire-on-school-grounds/) to give users real-time insights into the frequency, geographic spread, and outcomes of these tragic events.

## Overview

Gun-related violence on school grounds is a critical issue that affects students, educators, and communities. This dashboard aims to:

- Present **yearly and monthly trends** to illustrate how incidents have evolved over time.
- Provide **interactive filtering** for deeper insights into specific states, time frames, or types of incidents (intent).
- Highlight **key metrics**, including total incidents, lives lost, and injuries.
- Offer **visual context** via maps and charts, illuminating where and how these incidents occur most frequently.

By converting raw data into easily interpretable visuals, this project aspires to inform researchers, policymakers, educators, and the general public, guiding meaningful conversations and potential preventative measures.

  The data includes incident date, location, intent, and casualties, updated by Everytown on a rolling basis.

- **Scope & Limitations**:  
  - Data may be **partial** for recent years (e.g., 2025) as incidents might be newly reported or under investigation.
